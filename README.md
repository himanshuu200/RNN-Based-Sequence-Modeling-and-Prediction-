# RNN-Based Sequence Modeling and Prediction üìäüß†
Exploring the power of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) for sequence data!

This project demonstrates the use of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) for sequence modeling and prediction tasks. RNNs are a class of neural networks designed to handle sequential data, making them ideal for applications like time series forecasting, text generation, and more. This repository provides a clear implementation of RNNs, along with tools for training, evaluating, and visualizing results on sequential datasets.

Features ‚ú®
RNN Implementation: A hands-on implementation of Recurrent Neural Networks.
Sequence Prediction: Predict future values or sequences based on historical data.
Data Preprocessing: Tools for preparing sequential data for training.
Visualization: Plotting tools to compare predictions with actual data.
Flexible and Customizable: Easily adapt the model to your own sequential dataset.

How It Works üõ†Ô∏è
Data Preparation: Sequential data is preprocessed and split into training and testing sets.
Model Training: An RNN model is built and trained on the sequential data.
Prediction: The trained model is used to predict future sequences or values.
Evaluation: Model performance is evaluated using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) or Mean Absolute Error (MAE).

Technologies Used üíª
TensorFlow/Keras: For building and training the RNN model.
Pandas & NumPy: For data manipulation and preprocessing.
Matplotlib & Seaborn: For data visualization.
Scikit-learn: For evaluation metrics and data splitting.

Applications üåê
Time series forecasting (e.g., stock prices, weather data)
Text generation and language modeling
Anomaly detection in sequential data
Predictive maintenance and IoT data analysis
